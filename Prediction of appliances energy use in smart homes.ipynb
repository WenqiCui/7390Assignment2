    "## Prediction of appliances energy use in smart homes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.Introduction\n",
    "Energy consumption in the residential sector represents an important part of the total electricity demand. The purpose of this paper is to predict the energy consumption in houses for the next 24 h, as the energy price in the day-ahead market is set for each hourly interval with one day advance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.The need for energy prediction in housing\n",
    "The concept of smart grid appeared as an answer to the new power system challenges. Smart grid integrates the use of sensors, communications, computational ability and control in order to enhance the overall functionality of the electric power system. Smart grid initiatives seek to improve operations, maintenance and planning using modern technology in order to better manage energy use and costs \n",
    "\n",
    "The energy market is a key instrument in the smart grid. The power suppliers involved have to predict the next day consumption with good precision in order to obtain good prices for the traded energy.\n",

    "#### 3.1 Assessing the performance of predictors\n",
    "In order to evaluate the performance of predictors, some concepts have to be defined. Let h be the current hour and e(h) be a binary value which is equal to 0 if the considered appliance is actually consuming energy during the hour h and 1 otherwise. Let pa(h) be a prediction provided by the predictor a, which is equal to 1 if the considered appliance is predicted as consuming power during the hour h and 0 otherwise. The precision of the predictor is then expressed by:\n",

    "### 4.Global study of the services in the house\n",
    "\n",
    "The global study of the different appliances in houses shows that the prediction acts in a special manner depending on the type of the electrical appliance. The prediction precision for the refrigerator or the freezer  is lower than the precision assuming permanent consumption for time windows higher than 14 days. This implies that the prediction for these appliances should be done considering a short period of historical data (e.g. two weeks) in order to get a high performance. This conclusion was expected since the energy consumption for these appliances is dependent on the season, so a short period of time is significant for prediction. The performance of prediction for the TV or non-halogen lighting is higher than the performance of the basic predictors for the entire recorded data interval .\n",
    "### 5.Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting the energy consumption in homes is an important aspect in the power management of the grid, as the consumption in the residential sector represents a significant percentage in the total electricity demand. The development of the smart grid is not possible without a good prediction of energy consumption. The trend nowadays is to get the prediction of energy consumption not only at house level, but at household appliance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction of energy consumption in housing is very dependent on inhabitants' behavior, so a stochastic method for prediction has been presented in this paper. The paper discusses about how to evaluate the precision of a predictor in the day + 1 power management context. Different basic predictors are presented and tested for the available historical data. A relevant predictor is presented. It is based on the segmentation of data considering the patterns in energy consumption. The historical data is divided according to the results of the k-means clustering algorithm. This procedure improves the precision of the predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further work involves testing the proposed predictor for all the appliances in a house in order to decide the proper way for prediction at the equipment level.\n",
